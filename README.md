## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is my first project into the Data Science field to apply the Crips-DM ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining)) methodology.

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb listing data of Seattle to better understand:
- What is the interesting parts about the data, included pricing, size, how to create a good description for a listing...
- What aspect impact the pricing and popularity of a listing


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

- `Seattle Airbnb analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook file included all the works. This included 4 parts:
1. Part 1: Review & cleanup data
2. Part 2: Pricing overview
3. Part 3: How to get good impression by title, description & user reviews
4. Part 4: What aspect affect pricing & user review
- `data/listings.csv`: detail of the listing, include detail of rental, place, pricing, user review
- `data/reviews.csv`: detail of all review of places
- `data/calendar.csv`: detail of pricing & avaiability of listings by day
- `output`: folder containing output tables, images
