## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@bestoneguy/how-to-create-a-best-listing-on-airbnb-a-study-from-seattle-airbnb-listing-data-9055d4b92be3).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
